	help
	 Select this option to enable a driver for using the SHA engine in
	 the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	 Enabling this allows the use of SHA operations in hardware without requiring the
	 SHA software implementations. It also improves performance and saves code size.

	bool "ASPEED RSA and ECC Engine"
	depends on ASPEED_AST2600
	help
	 Select this option to enable a driver for using the RSA/ECC engine in
	 the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	 Enabling this allows the use of RSA/ECC operations in hardware without requiring the
	 software implementations. It also improves performance and saves code size.
