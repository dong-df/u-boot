	bool "ASPEED Hash and Crypto Engine"
	depends on DM_HASH
	help
	  Select this option to enable a driver for using the SHA engine in
	  the ASPEED BMC SoCs.

	  Enabling this allows the use of SHA operations in hardware without
	  requiring the SHA software implementations. It also improves performance
	  and saves code size.
